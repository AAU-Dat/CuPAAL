# Dependencies
This project relies on the CUDD library for the implementation of ADDs, and the Storm library for parsing Prism models

There are two immediate options for developing this library. Either you

1. Install Storm on your machine, which includes CUDD (**Recommended**, Linux)
2. Use the supplied devcontainer built on the storm image (Windows)
